# ONLINE LEARNING AS A DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY #

The Internet has changed the lives of humans forever. In this Age, it is modern man's tool for survival as well as a source of information, livelihood, entertainment, and now more 
importantly, learning. MOOCs are a form of online learning and is slowly gaining attention, especially in this pandemic. MOOCs are Massive Online Open Courses. What is does is, that
it offers College courses online, meaning anyone with a good internet connection and reliable Computer, smartphone, or tablet, can access these courses from the internet. MOOCs are mostly 
free and if they do charge it is a small amount, usually for certificates in the course.

MOOCs is a form of online learning, and since its launch in 2011, its popularity had risen and fallen. Currently, it is becoming popular again because of the pandemic and the 
relatively larger free time people have. Sites like, Skillshare, Udacity, Udemy, EdX, and Coursera are lately gaining more patrons and with it an increase in business. Most of 
these course-based sites offer free lessons with a minimum fee (for certificates). Which is why it is a disruptive innovation. The attraction of a low-cost, "OK" quality product 
is the main hallmark of a disruptor. It verily captures the underserved market, providing good alternatives to otherwise expensive options available to them. 


### _DEFINITION OF TERMS:_ ###
+ **UPMARKET:**  refers to the tier above the market the entrant is currently dominating.

+ **INCUMBENT:** companies that are presently dominating the market of a certain product.

+ **ENTRANT:**  companies who’ve just started to compete in the markets, beginning at the lowest tier of the market (least demanding customers).

+ **NEW VALUE NETWORK:** refers to a new group of consumers that are brought into the competing markets by the disruptive innovation. 

+ **SUSTAINING TECHNOLOGY:** a business strategy where established products (bestseller) are upgraded and improved in a short time meaning more financial gains.

+ **UNDERSERVED:** The easiest to satisfy in the consumer tiers. They are those who prefer cheap, "OK" quality products rather than the expensive but sturdy-quality products.

+ **MOOCs:** Online Courses offered by some Universities for free to establish wide-spread access and engagement.

## WHAT ARE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES? ##

Disruptive Technologies or disruptive innovations are defined by Clayton Christensen as, ***“…it transforms a product that historically was so expensive and complicated that only 
a few people with a lot of money and a lot of skill had access to it. Disruptive innovation makes it so much more affordable and accessible to a much larger population.”(2012)***
Basically, it is a strategy that companies (entrant) use by offering products that are low-quality and cheap versions of other more expensive products. Overtime, product’s quality 
improves, and in doing so garners more patrons upmarket, until they are level with big companies (incumbent), which by then causes a “disruption” in the market. 

It is possible in businesses to have an idea that is innovative but not disruptive. The 3-set litmus test below is the standard indicator that determines whether or not an idea 
is disruptive.

3 set Litmus Test for Disruptive Ideas:

-	**Set 1:**
1.	Is there a large population of people who historically have not had the money, equipment, or skill to do this thing for themselves, and as a result have gone without it 
altogether or have needed to pay someone with more expertise to do it for them? 

2.	To use the product or service, do customers need to go to an inconvenient, centralized location? 

-	**Set 2:**
1.	Are there customers at the low end of the market who would be happy to purchase a product with less (but good enough) performance if they could get it at a lower price? 

2.	Can we create a business model that enables us to earn attractive profits at the discount prices required to win the business of these overserved customers at the low end?

-	**Set 3:**

1.	Is the innovation disruptive to all of the significant incumbent firms in the industry? If it appears to be sustaining to one or more significant players in the industry, then 
the odds will be stacked in that firm’s favor, and the entrant is unlikely to win.

(Christensen, 1997)

Christensen also stated that disruption is partly about consumers establishing the purpose of technologies through practice (Christensen and Raynor, 2003).

Markides’ (2006) added on to this and stated that disruptive technologies do not happen naturally, but are created through practice. Michael Flavin, Head of Curriculum Innovation at King's College London, adds on to Markides’ argument and cited Wikipedia as an example: encyclopedias are established forms of publication, but Wikipedia has changed the way they are distributed, produced, and consumed. 

Therefore, astute practice of a technology gives rise to disruption and not its intrinsic features (Christensen and Raynor, 2003). This is because practice “does not occur in a vacuum but is shaped by underpinning economic and social factors (Flavin, 2012).”

### WHAT IS ONLINE LEARNING? ###

Online Learning, also called e-learning, is any form of learning that uses the internet as a means of delivering lessons and instruction (Malamed, C, n.d.). Online learning evolved from **distance learning** which is the term used for any learning that "takes place across distance and not in a traditional
classroom" (Stern,n.d.). Nowadays, online laerning takes many forms such as MOOCS (Massive Online Open Courses), course-based websites (e.g. Udemy, Khan Academy, Skillshare, and Domestika), language tutorial apps (e.g. Duolingo and Drops) and many more. 

From "virtual classrooms" of the past, many colleges and universities today make use of Course Management System (CMS) to conduct online learning. Examples of for-profit CMS include: Blackboard (www.blackboard.com), WebCT (www.webct.com) and eCollege (www.ecollege.com) while low cost alternative and open source CMS include: ETUDES-NG (http://etudesproject.org), Moodle (http://moodle.org) and Angel (http://angellearning.com). CMS offers tools such as schedule, announcements, syllabus, modules, assignments, discussion board, private messages, chat, tests & quizzes and gradebook that creates a learning environment where educators can deliver course content, enable
communications, and conduct evaluations.

## WHY IS ONLINE LEARNING A DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION? ##

**Online Learning is disruptive for 4 reasons:**

-	It caters to those who do not have the financial means to pay for education but wish to learn.
-	It is accessible everywhere so long as there is internet available.
-	It affords more flexibility in terms of time.
-	The platforms that offer the courses are easy to use.

     The cost of a college education here in the Philippines ranges from P300,000 to P100,000. While, Skillshare 
     prices their tutorials at P1200 Annually and P400 monthly and Udemy prices their courses at $9.99 (P481) per 
     course. These low prices are the ones that draw in the consumers as well as its accessibility over the 
     internet.

Online learning is legitimately “disruptive” because it passes the 3-set Litmus Test, also created by Clayton Christensen but we used the more recent metric, from the Clayton Christensen Institute to determine if the idea/product is indeed disruptive:

**1. Does it target nonconsumers or people who are overserved by an incumbent’s existing offering in market?**

Depends, but yes. MOOCs have a wide range of targets. The most common users of MOOCs however are students, adults, and lifelong learners. People within the average age range of students are arguably underserved by existing education offerings given the state of non-education; therefore it could be said that potential students are nonconsumers. Adults, especially working adults, also don’t have the time to enter full-time college courses, making MOOCs a viable option to continue learning.

**2. Is the offering not as good as an incumbent’s existing offering as judged by historical measures of performance?**

Yes. Initially MOOCs, such as Coursera did not provide academic credit, although they were free. While they did provide courses arguably of the same quality as attending an actual college course, they weren’t necessarily useful to their target market. The courses provided no contribution to an individual’s degree program. It does provide certification, but that doesn’t have as much clout as a full degree.

**3. Is the innovation simpler to use, or more convenient or more affordable than the incumbent’s existing offering?**

Yes. Its mere presence on the internet fulfills all the above conditions, excepting simplicity. Internet usage requires a measure of skill on its own that certain adult demographics do not have. However, in general, its accessibility makes up for it. MOOCs are accessible from a user’s own home, which also touches on affordability. Even if the prices were the same for an MOOC and a physical class, if we view price outside of the simplistic context of money and add in other resources expended to attend physical college classes, such as travel time, energy expenditure, and psychological stressors, MOOCs win out on affordability.

However, quality of education for cost may suffer: online courses are yet to be as widely accepted as physical classing.

**4. Does the offering have a technological enabler that can carry it to upmarket and allow it to improve?**

Yes: the internet, and the communication technologies that carry it.
  
**5. Is the technology paired with a business model innovation that allows it to be sustainable?**

Yes. Online marketing and digital commerce have been around for decades, starting with AuctionWeb in 1995. Online transactions have dramatically improved since then, allowing people to purchase practically anything online, if they know where to look.

**6. Are existing providers motivated to ignore the new innovation and not threatened at the outset?**

Technically, no. However, due to the social stigma of online classes, they aren’t immediately threatened by it: socially speaking, someone graduating from an MOOC would not have the same level of social awe as a graduate from a top-end university such as Harvard University. However, the innovation is not being ignored by existing providers: MOOCs often include courses taught by these same high-end universities. Existing providers, such as UP, are also adopting the new innovation into their systems.


(Christensen, 1997)


## HOW DOES ONLINE LEARNING DISRUPT TRADITIONAL FACE-TO-FACE EDUCATION? ##

According to statistics taken from Purdue University & The National Center for Education Statistics, more than 6 million students are participating in online courses as part of their higher education program in 2017 (Online Learning - What is it and how does it work?, 2017). This number continue to rapidly increase each year especially today with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, showing evidence of disruption. This also further strengthens Flavin's (2012) aforementioned statement about how economic and social factors influence the rise of disruptive technologies. With the introduction of online learning technology, many educational institutions are forced to radically change the way they “operate, educate and innovate” to accommodate the changing needs and environment of the modern student. Factors such as education budget cuts from governments and students not being able to afford the high costs of tuition have driven technology to change policies and practices when it comes to higher education. There’s also a clamor for more efficient learning than the traditional education where learning is measured by how efficient students could memorize the lessons instead of understanding it. Arising from this perspective is a “new understanding of how learning happens” and this is how and why, Meyer theorizes disruption could occur (Meyer,2010).

Online learning also taps into new market of non-traditional students who in the past would have limited access to education. Examples are parents, the fully employed and physically challenged students. Online learning levels the playing field where discrimination regarding age, physical appearance, disabilities, race and gender are eliminated. Thus, the focus is on the learning itself and how well a student respond to the course materials. Studies made by the US Department of Education show that students performed better in online courses that face-to-face courses and better still with blended online and face-to-face learning (Meyer,2010). According to the studies, this is because students have more time to spend time on a task at hand, giving them more control over the process of their learning. With continuous access to the course materials, students can take the time to reflect on their study. Students are also encouraged to explore other tools and softwares according to their needs.

Online learning will appeal to students most especially those who have learning styles different from what a traditional classroom implements. With online learning, learning can be personalized. Now, students can learn anytime and anywhere.

Online learning also offers new opportunities for educators to create and develop new dynamic courses of the highest quality. With the use of the internet, resources around the world have never been more accessible. Experts from various fields could also join online discussions to interact with students, further increasing quality and relevance of education. New innovations such as competency-based education (CBE) has enabled the pedagogy to assess the student’s different skills and proficiencies, making learning self-paced and individual-focused, therefore more efficient and effective (Strengths and Weaknesses of Online Learning,2020).

Online learning is also beneficial to both students and educators because of ease in communication. By providing instantaneous feedback, aside from saving time, educators can shift focus and perspective, and ultimately help students develop personal goals toward their own learning.

Cleborne Maddux and D. Lamont also describes the use of technology in education where Type I uses of technology “automates or replicates an existing practice” and Type II uses of technology “allow students and teachers to do things that could not be done before (Meyer, 2010).

     An example of CBE is REX Book Store's Learning Pathways. According to REX, Learning Pathways "is one
     such tool that helps students achieve mastery of essential learning competencies and skills–and it is
     available at their fingertips! A competency-based online learning platform, it comesin the form of a
     handy mobile app that allows students to learn at their own pace, anytime andanywhere!" Visit this link

The new learning experience puts the student in focus, where their needs and convenience translates to effective education. It pushes new ways to create a learning environment where students are motivated to learn course materials in their own way as well as creating new knowledge along the way.
